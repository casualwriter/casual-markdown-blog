## Build online resume by markdown

![markdown resume](http://casualwriter.github.io/casual-markdown/casual-markdown-cv.png)

It is quite annoying to maintain resume in multiple format, MS Word, PDF, TXT as well as wanna to have an HTML format online. 

found Github markdown editor is very handy to draft a nice resume. Here is a sample template: [resume.md](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/blob/main/resume.md), however, it is not good enough to send to recruiter.

so, add a little code, and transform to online resume with nice [layout](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume.html) (self-host at github).

then may print it to PDF format, and share by url. (for github, it can accessed by raw.githack.com natually)

### Themes

The following themes are available 

* resume.html // default theme  [(preview)](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume.html)
* resume-qrcode.html // show QR code of URL [(preview)](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume-qrcode.html)
* resume-dark.html // dark theme [(preview)](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume-dark.html)
* resume-warm.html // warm theme [(preview)](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume-warm.html)
* resume-blue.html // blue theme [(preview)](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume-blue.html)
* resume-web.html // sample for web developer [(preview)](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/resume-web.html)

Sorry for my poor UI design, if still not good enough, please fork [casual-markdown-cv](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv) and make your own.

by the way, this template basically use markdown as web page, which not limit for resume purpose. for example,

* [project-plan.html](project-plan.html) // project plan [(preview)](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/project-plan.html)
* [document.html](document.html) // documentation [(preview)](https://raw.githack.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-cv/main/document.html)

Have a nice day, with great career prosects,
